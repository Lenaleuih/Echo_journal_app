    <string name="text1">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth; by Foster</string>
    <string name="text2">The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough; by Ezra pound</string>
    <string name="text3">No desire opens me: I am full,
I never close myself with refusal-
in the rhythm of my daily soul
I do not desire-I am moved; by Rilke</string>
